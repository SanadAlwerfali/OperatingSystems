# Real-time Operating Systems 👨🏻‍💻
This repo is for the RTOS class, just to keep track of my tutorials and labs.
Please note that I don't allow my code to be used without my permission. Thanks 😊

To learn how to build the tutorials navigate to `./Tutorials` and run `make help`

### Lab #1 
The goal of this lab is to explore how programs work when you don’t get as much help from the compiler or run-time as you would with a higher-level language like C++, Go, Java or Rust. By the end of this lab you should be able to:

1. manage memory manually,

2. use (and misuse!) C-style strings,

3. use libc functions for I/O,

4. use compiler flags, manual pages and inspection tools such as nm(1) and objdump(1),

5. discuss symbol naming in C vs C++ and other languages, and

6. write and use C macros.
